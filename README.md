### Hi, This is Can. 
I am into web design and full stack development 
I am currently using HTML CSS and JS for Frontend Design and Development 
I am currently working on stajup.com and aÄ±ming on expanding my proffesional portfolio with possible design jobs and more experience. 
When I feel somewhat confident with myself in this area I will move on to discovering AI and experimenting on it to see what is plausible.
